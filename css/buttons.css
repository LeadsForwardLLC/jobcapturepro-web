/**
 * Button Component Styles (Legacy Shim)
 *
 * NOTE:
 * - Functional .btn/.btn-primary/.btn-secondary styles now live in
 *   `css/components.css` under the
 *   \"BUTTON COMPONENT - SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH\" section.
 * - This file is intentionally kept as an empty, non-functional shim
 *   so the `jcp-core-buttons` handle and enqueue order remain intact.
 *
 * DO NOT add new button rules here. Update `css/components.css` instead.
